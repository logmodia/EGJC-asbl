## EGJC web site project

EGJC is a Protestant Church based in Li√®ge.

For the visibility of its activities to the general public (via the Internet) and to allow members to have easy access to information concerning the organization and functioning of the Church, it needs a dynamic website.

The main objectives of creating this website are:

- Allow everyone, wherever they may be, to know the EGJC and its activities by providing all the necessary information concerning the life of the Church. It is therefore the showcase part of the site that is supposed to fulfill this task.
- The site must be well organized and with an attractive design to allow visitors to easily find information and navigate without difficulty.
- The site must be accessible from smart phones, tablets, PCs and any other devices capable of connecting to the internet and viewing web pages
- The site must allow the updating (addition, modification, deletion) of the content (especially for dynamic data).
- The site must guarantee data security by implementing:
  - data protection mechanisms against cyber attacks,
  - data protection authentication system to secure access to the administrative part and manage users
